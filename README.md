## 🚀 Features (Planned & In Progress)

### 🌱 Crop Health & Disease Detection
- Uses a **trained deep learning model** (CNN-based) to detect crop diseases from leaf images.  
- Provides visual feedback and possible treatment recommendations.

### 📊 Yield Prediction
- Predicts potential crop yield using ML models based on soil, weather, and crop data.  
- Helps optimize planting and harvesting decisions.

### ☁️ Firebase Integration
- User authentication (email/password, Google Sign-In).  
- Real-time database and cloud storage for user data, crop images, and predictions.  
- Secure and scalable backend.

### 🧠 AI & ML Integration
- Models trained in **TensorFlow / PyTorch** integrated into Flutter via REST APIs or TFLite.  
- NLP-powered insights and recommendations.

### 💬 Smart Fertilizer Recommendation
- Suggests fertilizer combinations based on soil nutrients, crop type, and weather conditions.

### 📱 Intuitive Flutter UI
- Clean and responsive interface.  
- Compatible with Android and iOS.
